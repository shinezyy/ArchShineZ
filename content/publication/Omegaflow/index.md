abstract: This paper investigates how to better track and deliver dependency in dependency-based cores to exploit instruction-level parallelism (ILP) as much as possible. To this end, we first propose an analytical performance model for the state-of-art dependency-based core, Forwardflow, and figure out two vital factors affecting its upper bound of performance. Then we propose Omegaflow,a dependency-based architecture adopting three new techniques, which respond to the discovered factors. Experimental results show that Omegaflow improves IPC by 24.6% compared to the state-of-the-art design, approaching the performance of the OoO architecture with an ideal scheduler (94.4%) without increasing the clock cycle and consumes only 8.82% more energy than Forwardflow.
