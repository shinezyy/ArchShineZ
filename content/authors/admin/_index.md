I am interested in techniques and researches about CPU ILP enhancement
- Prefetchers
- Scalable cores
- Performance evaluation and bottleneck analysis

I have collaborated with my team to develop the micro-architecture simulator for the Xiangshan processor.
I played a significant role in the design of the 3rd generation architecture of the Xiangshan processor,
achieving a SPECint2k6 score of 15/GHz on both C++ simulator and RTL.

My hobbies include playing table tennis, evaluating Android open source ROMs, and reading papers on health and biology.
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and B.Sc. degree from Nanjing University.
